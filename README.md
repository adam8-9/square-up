# square-up
- This is a fighting game I made with unity and c# which was part of my A level assignment.
- You can play as goku or broly in 4 different maps of your choice. Each of the characters have thier own animations when fighting. 
- It's a pvp game, so 2 players can play at the same time on a keyboard.
